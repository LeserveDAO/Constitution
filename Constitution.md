# The Constitution of Leserve DAO

*Version 1.0 ([changelog](./Changelog.md))*

*We the people of Leserve, do acknowledge and respect the undeniable human right to acquire financial freedom. Leserve DAO delivers and enforces this right through a fully digital reserve asset that remains independent of any government, currency or centralized institution.*

*This constitution is established to embed and solidify the core values, principles and vision underpinning the Leserve protocol. The constitution shall be deemed as a fundamental pillar of the protocol fostering and cementing its social contracts, structure, functionality, integration and long-term alignment of its members.*

*While its exact form and state may be gradually altered and modified according to the amendments and propositions put forward by the DAO and the Leservian community, it shall encourage the long-term prosperity, independence and welfare of the protocol and its people.*


# Article I — The governing principles

(1) Leserve DAO is a decentralized autonomous organisation. It transcends borders and has a global reach with the overarching aim of bringing a solid and reliable reserve currency to every corner of the world in a decentralized, accessible manner.

(2) The governance principle shall be that of the meritocracy with democratic oversight of sLSRV/wsLSRV holders. We believe that a governance structure that values and emphasizes input from highly knowledgeable and engaged individuals who are deeply immersed in the Leserve community, will inherently lead to optimal results for the whole DAO and all sLSRV/wsLSRV holders. The executive power is held by those that contribute most to the success of the protocol.

(3) The DAO expects the governance participants to operate and communicate with integrity and with respect for each other.

(4) Proposals and discussions about them shall be backed by rational arguments, facts and data.

(5) When deliberating how to vote and govern, one should ask the following core question: **“*What maximizes the long-term wellbeing of the Leserve community?*”** This should be the main guiding principle underpinning the entire governance.

(6) As a DAO, we reject harassment of any kind. Any abuse that is directed towards anyone from the Leserve DAO community shall be met with strict penalties and repercussions.

(7) The governance shall be performed and executed both on-chain and off-chain. The DAO strives to have most of the consensus-building off-chain and most of the decisions voted and executed on-chain.


# Article II — The rights of the different government departments

(1) The government shall be composed of 3 councils, The judiciary and the general assembly. Each of the government departments shall have the right to execute and operate within its defined capacity.

(4) The general assembly shall evaluate and determine the priority of the roadmap and determine the council inclusiveness through conviction voting.
